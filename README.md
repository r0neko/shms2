# S.H.M.S Hub Software - version 2

This is the second and latest version of the S.H.M.S. Hub Firmware Code. The new version is more stable and it's rewritten in C++(with parts still in C).

# How to build?

Just `make`. I reworked the building process

# Please note that I'm not providing any support for this, as it is an discarded project... for now. :))
